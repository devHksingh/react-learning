# prefetchQuery

To use prefetchQuery with React Query, you can follow these steps. prefetchQuery is used to load data into the cache before it is needed, which can improve the performance of your application by reducing the time it takes to load data when a component mounts.

Here's an example of how to use prefetchQuery:

Import necessary modules: You need to import QueryClient and prefetchQuery from @tanstack/react-query.

Create a Query Client: Initialize a new QueryClient instance.

Prefetch the Query: Use prefetchQuery to load data into the cache. You need to provide a queryKey and a queryFn that fetches the data.

Use the prefetched data: In your component, use useQuery with the same queryKey to access the prefetched data.

Here is a code example:

```javascript
import { QueryClient, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// Function to fetch posts
async function fetchPosts() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/posts');
  return response.json();
}

// Prefetching function
async function prefetchPosts() {
  const queryClient = new QueryClient();

  await queryClient.prefetchQuery({
    queryKey: ['posts'],
    queryFn: fetchPosts,
  });
}

// Component to display posts
function Posts() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['posts'],
    queryFn: fetchPosts,
  });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// Call prefetchPosts somewhere in your app, e.g., in an event handler or during server-side rendering
prefetchPosts();


```

In this example, prefetchPosts is a function that initializes a QueryClient and uses prefetchQuery to load posts data into the cache. The Posts component then uses useQuery with the same queryKey to access the cached data, which will be available immediately if it has been prefetched
