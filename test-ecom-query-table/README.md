staleTime
Definition:
staleTime is the duration (in milliseconds) for which fetched data is considered fresh (or "stale"). While data is fresh, React Query won’t automatically refetch it in the background.

Benefits:

Reduces Unnecessary Network Requests:
If your data doesn’t change often, setting a higher staleTime prevents React Query from making repeated API calls.
Improves Performance:
It minimizes loading states and refetches, making your application feel faster.
Optimizes User Experience:
Fresh data means users can see data instantly without waiting for a background fetch if they revisit the same query within the staleTime period.
Example:

js
Copy
Edit
useQuery({
  queryKey: ['posts'],
  queryFn: fetchPosts,
  staleTime: 60000, // Data is fresh for 60 seconds
});
cacheTime
Definition:
cacheTime is the time (in milliseconds) that unused or inactive data remains in the cache before being garbage collected. It kicks in after the data becomes stale.

Benefits:

Efficient Memory Management:
It helps free up memory by discarding data that hasn’t been accessed for a specified duration.
Quick Data Restoration:
If a user returns to a query within the cacheTime, React Query can quickly show the cached data, even if it’s stale, and then refetch if necessary.
Flexibility for Repeated Access:
You can set a longer cacheTime if you expect users to revisit the same data frequently, reducing the need to refetch.
Example:

js
Copy
Edit
useQuery({
  queryKey: ['posts'],
  queryFn: fetchPosts,
  cacheTime: 300000, // Data remains in cache for 5 minutes after becoming stale
});
How They Work Together:
Fresh Data (within staleTime):
Data is considered fresh and no refetch is triggered when components mount.

Stale Data (after staleTime but before cacheTime):
Data remains in the cache and is immediately available, but React Query may refetch it in the background when needed.

Cache Expiration (after cacheTime):
If the query isn’t used within this time frame, the cached data is removed from memory.

When to Use Each:
Set a Higher staleTime for data that doesn’t change often (e.g., configuration data or rarely updated lists) to improve performance and reduce network traffic.
Set cacheTime based on how long you want to keep data in memory after it’s not actively used. A longer cacheTime can be useful if users frequently navigate back to the same data.
